# Place to store my thoughts while I work

-Dependencies
right now the dependicies are: sqlite3 (part of standard library), and websocket

-GOALS

THINGS WE WANT TO CHECK:
	that the distribution of their random generator matches with the real distribution we scrape

	want to see expected values of return, as well as losses. Basically plot everything about the $$ we can

THINGS WE NEED TO DO:
	Basically need to webscrape the site until we have the results of a full 'game', then add the scraped game to our database as a 'GAME', add all 'USERS' to that table, and make a new table for each game in GAMES.


--BIG FIND
	All of the data we want is in a websocket located at 'wss://csgomagic.com/socket.io/?EIO=3&transport=websocket' however if you aren't logged in with steam it only streams you the simple data (just onlineCount data). We need to get through the steam logon issue.


setup situation:
	main file will create a scraper object that it can just pull data from when ready our main loop will be like
	while True:
		scraper.get_new_data() #this will take time to collect and return a response
		(sort data)


	scraper object setup will be in charge of generating dump objects for us to sort in main
